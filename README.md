# Development of Mini game: Rock Paper Scissor

# 1.1. Details about repo

- This repository will be used to download completed laboratory work in the discipline CSAD.
- This repository will also contain all the intermediate stages of development up to a complete functional project.

# 1.2. Task details

This project focuses on creating a digital version of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors, emphasizing its mechanics, implementation, and user experience. Using modern programming languages and development tools, we aim to develop an interactive game that retains the core essence of this timeless competition while integrating contemporary features like graphical user interfaces, score tracking, and improved gameplay dynamics.

# 1.3. Student number and details

- Student number: 24;
- Game: Rock Paper Scissors;
- Config format: INI.

# 1.4. Details about technology, program language, and HW

This project is particularly interesting as it will be built on a client-server architecture, as specified by the task. The client will be an application that receives data from the server, which in this case will be an Arduino board responsible for performing all the calculations. The result will then be sent back to the user through the application. The application itself is planned to be developed using one of the cross-platform programming languages, such as Java, C++, or C#. The final choice of language will be made once the development process begins.
