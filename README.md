# Development of Mini game: Rock Paper Scissor

# 1.1. Details about repo

- This repository will be used to download completed laboratory work in the discipline CSAD.
- This repository will also contain all the intermediate stages of development up to a complete functional project.

# 1.2. Task details

This project aims to explore the development of a digital version of Rock, Paper, Scissors, focusing on the gameâ€™s mechanics, implementation, and user experience. By utilizing contemporary programming languages and development tools, we will create an interactive game that captures the essence of this age-old contest while incorporating modern features such as graphical user interfaces, score tracking, and enhanced gameplay dynamics.

# 1.3. Student number and details

- Student number: 12;
- Game: Rock Paper Scissors;
- Config format: INI.

# 1.4. Details about technology, program language, and HW

This project is interesting because it will be based on a client-server architecture, which is provided for by the task. The client is an application that receives information from the server. The role of the server is played by an Arduino board on which all calculations are performed, and the result is returned to the user in the application. The application is planned to be designed in one of the cross-platform programming languages. It will be either Java, C++, or C#. I will finally decide on the language when the development process begins.
